Election Outcome Prediction Using Social Media Sentiment Analysis

Overview

This project demonstrates how to predict election outcomes by analyzing the sentiment of social media posts using machine learning models. The project compares two different approaches:

1. Naive Bayes Classifier: A simple yet effective model for text classification.


2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM): A deep learning model well-suited for sequence data, such as text.



By applying these models to social media data, we aim to classify whether a post has a positive or negative sentiment, which can help gauge public opinion about election candidates.

Key Features

Sentiment Analysis: Classifies social media posts as either positive or negative.

Model Comparison: Compares the performance of a basic Naive Bayes classifier with a more advanced LSTM model.

Text Preprocessing: Includes steps to clean and prepare text data for machine learning models.

Evaluation: Displays model accuracy to help determine which method performs better.


Project Structure

data_preprocessing.py: Handles loading the dataset, cleaning the text, and splitting the data into training and test sets.

naive_bayes_model.py: Implements a Naive Bayes classifier to predict sentiment.

lstm_model.py: Implements an LSTM neural network for sentiment analysis.

main.py: The main script that runs both models and compares their performance.

social_media_data.csv: Example dataset containing social media posts and their corresponding sentiment labels.


How It Works

1. Dataset:

A sample dataset (social_media_data.csv) is used, containing social media posts labeled as either positive or negative.



2. Naive Bayes Model:

Uses a Bag-of-Words approach to convert text into numerical features and trains the Naive Bayes classifier to classify sentiment.



3. LSTM Model:

Tokenizes and pads the text data, and then trains an LSTM neural network to capture more complex patterns in the text.



4. Evaluation:

Both models are evaluated using the test set, and the accuracy of each model is displayed.
